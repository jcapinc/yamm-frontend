# Yet Another Money Manager: Frontend
This is a simple app meant to help people manage their money. You can import transactions from an IIF file (deplicates get ignored). 
Once transactions are imported you can manually categorize them, or you can define rules with regular expressions that determine what 
a transaction should categorize into.
